YOUR TASK  
From the GIVEN LIST of candidate ESCO concepts, select ALL ESCO knowledge elements that the given university curriculum element (topic, course, programme, or study field) could reasonably be expected to teach a typical student.

OUTPUT FORMAT  
Return ONLY a single JSON object.  
Do NOT include any explanations, comments, markdown, or additional text.

The JSON MUST be valid and follow EXACTLY this schema:

{
  "rtu_neo4j_element_id": "<string>",
  "selected_esco_ids": ["<string>", "..."]
}

Where:
- "rtu_neo4j_element_id" MUST be exactly the "element_id" of the curriculum element from the input.
- "selected_esco_ids" MUST be a list of unique "neo4j_element_id" values taken from the selected candidate ESCO concepts.
- If none of the candidates can clearly be taught by this curriculum element, return an empty list for "selected_esco_ids".

STRICT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS
- Use double quotes for all JSON keys and string values.
- Do not include trailing commas.
- Do not include comments, markdown, or any text before or after the JSON.
